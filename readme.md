## Python SLEUTH

SLEUTH is an open-source cellular automata-based land use change simulation model. 
The purpose of the SLEUTH model is to simulate future land use and urban planning scenarios. 
However, the current model of SLEUTH was originally written in the language C and can only be 
run in environments that have a C-compiler. Because of the complexity of several components, it 
is difficult for new users to get started using the model. 

## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to adapt the SLEUTH model to improve ease of use and 
portability to increase the usability of the model for land use or urban modeling 
simulation. This is done by translating the SLEUTH model into Python.
